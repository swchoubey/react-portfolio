									<h1 style="color: white;">Classification of Disaster Tweets</h1>
									<p style="color: white;">
										This Natural Language Processing (NLP) project is dedicated to classifying tweets into two distinct categories: those related to real disasters and those that are not. By employing advanced NLP techniques and machine learning algorithms, the project aims to automatically identify tweets containing information about actual disasters. This capability not only aids in the timely response to emergencies but also enhances support efforts by swiftly distinguishing between genuine disaster-related tweets and other content.

									<h2>Key Features</h2>
								</header>
								<ol type="1">
									<li>Text Preprocessing: Leveraging NLP techniques, the project employs comprehensive text preprocessing, tokenization, and feature extraction to transform raw text data into a machine-learning-friendly format. This step is crucial for extracting meaningful features from tweets.</li>
									<li>Machine Learning Models: Various machine learning algorithms, including the linear Support Vector Machine (SVM), are harnessed to classify tweets based on their content. These models undergo training on labeled data to predict whether a tweet pertains to a real disaster, showcasing the project's commitment to accurate and automated classification.</li>
									<li>Performance Evaluation: Rigorous performance evaluation is conducted, assessing the accuracy and efficiency of the machine learning models. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are employed to ensure reliable tweet classification. The accompanying image provides a visual comparison of the accuracy achieved by different models, highlighting the project's dedication to delivering robust and effective results.</li>

									<h2>Behind the Scenes of the Project</h2>
								</header>
								<p>The term disaster tweet classification does not really clarify what this project is about, so I will do it instead. Twitter (now X) is the most popular social network for real-time interaction on topics ranging from cats to national emergencies. Just like the wide variety of discussions, Twitter boasts a varied range of user ages as well. Some popular expressions used on the internet these days are, "That's fire!", "Ooh that burns", "I am shaking!" and so on. The aim of this project is to recognise that when someone tweets "That's lit!", are they talking about something that is literally on fire, constituting an emergency or are they simply amazed by something.                                </p>
