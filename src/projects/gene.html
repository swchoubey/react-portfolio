										Genetic Relation Detection is an innovative machine learning project designed to identify genetic relationships within photographs. Leveraging advanced machine learning models, the project analyzes image data to discern familial connections among individuals captured in photos. The primary objective is to contribute to the automated recognition of genetic relationships, enhancing the field of computer vision and family tree analysis.

									<h2>Behind the Scenes of the Project</h2>
								</header>
								<p>This project originated as part of the Introduction to Artificial Intelligence course, where students had the unique opportunity to learn from an ex-FBI agent. During the course, the agent shared insights into the critical role of genetic identification in criminal investigations. The real-world impact of DNA analysis was highlighted through the example of the Golden State Killer, who was apprehended after 40 years thanks to DNA analysis of a tissue found in his trash. This connection to a real-world scenario adds a fascinating layer to the project's context and underscores the significance of genetic analysis in various fields. Genetic Relation Detection not only pushes the boundaries of machine learning but also draws inspiration from practical applications in law enforcement and forensic science, showcasing the interdisciplinary nature of artificial intelligence.</p>
